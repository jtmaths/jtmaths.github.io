Create an HTML file using mathjaxs that I can download.  The html file should provide an overview of how students can solve quadratic equations of the form ax^2+bx+c=0 using the quadratic formula, giving some examples including quadratic graphs.  This should be aimed at Maths students aged 15 or 16.

Now create two HTML files using mathjaxs that I can download.  The first html file should provide a list of 20 questions on solving quadratic equations which can be rearranged into the form ax^2+bx+c=0 and can be solved using the quadratic formula without having to deal with imaginary numbers.  The second html file should contain a list of the solutions to each of these questions written out step by step.  These questions and answers should be aimed at Maths students aged 15 or 16.
