        <h1>An Introduction to Quadratic Equations ðŸ“ˆ</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the world of quadratic equations! You've likely solved linear equations like $x+3=5$, but quadratics are the next step up. They are incredibly useful in fields like physics, engineering, and finance.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>What is a Quadratic Equation?</h2>
        <p>A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of the second degree, meaning the highest power of the variable (usually $x$) is 2. The standard form of a quadratic equation is:</p>
        $$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$
        <p>Here's what the letters mean:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>$x$ is the variable.</li>
            <li>$a$, $b$, and $c$ are known numbers (coefficients and a constant).</li>
            <li>The one crucial rule is that <b>$a$ cannot be zero</b> ($a \neq 0$). If $a$ were 0, the $x^2$ term would disappear, and it would just be a linear equation!</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Graph of a Quadratic: The Parabola</h2>
        <p>When you plot a quadratic function like $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, it creates a beautiful, symmetrical U-shaped curve called a <b>parabola</b>.</p>
        <p>The coefficient '$a$' tells us which way the parabola opens:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If <b>$a > 0$</b> (positive), the parabola opens <b>upwards</b>, like a smile. For example, the graph of $y = x^2 - 4$.</li>
            <li>If <b>$a < 0$</b> (negative), the parabola opens <b>downwards</b>, like a frown. For example, the graph of $y = -x^2 + 2x + 3$.</li>
        </ul>



        <p>When we "solve" the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, we are finding the <b>roots</b>, which are the x-values where the graph crosses the x-axis (i.e., where $y=0$). A parabola can cross the x-axis twice, once, or not at all.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Solving a Simple Quadratic by Factorising</h2>
        <p>One of the most common ways to solve a quadratic equation is by factorising. Let's walk through an example.</p>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h3>Example: Solve $x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0$</h3>
            <p><b>Step 1: The Goal</b><br>
            We are looking for two numbers that do two things:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Multiply</b> to give the constant term, $c$, which is $+6$.</li>
                <li><b>Add</b> to give the coefficient of $x$, $b$, which is $+5$.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><b>Step 2: Find the Numbers</b><br>
            Let's think of pairs of numbers that multiply to make 6:
            (1 and 6), (2 and 3), (-1 and -6), (-2 and -3).
            Which pair also adds up to 5? It's <b>2 and 3</b>, since $2+3=5$. We found our numbers!</p>

            <p><b>Step 3: Factorise the Equation</b><br>
            Now we can rewrite the equation using these numbers in two brackets:</p>
            $$(x+2)(x+3) = 0$$

            <p><b>Step 4: Find the Solutions</b><br>
            If two things multiply together to make zero, one of them must be zero. This is a key rule in algebra. So, we can say that either the first bracket is zero, or the second bracket is zero.</p>
            <p>Either $x+2 = 0 \implies x = -2$</p>
            <p>Or $x+3 = 0 \implies x = -3$</p>

            <p><b>The solution is $x = -2$ or $x = -3$.</b> These are the two points on the x-axis where the parabola for $y = x^2 + 5x + 6$ would cross.</p>

        <p><a href="factors/questions.html">Factorising</a> is a great method, but it only works for some quadratics. For others, you'll learn about other techniques like "<a href="completing-the-square/completing-the-square.html">completing the square</a>" and the "<a href="formula/formula.html">quadratic formula</a>".</p>
