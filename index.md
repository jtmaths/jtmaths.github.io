This website is built as a free resource to help everyone understand school level maths, especially those in resource poor settings.
It was started by Jonas Thornhill as part of his [Gold Duke of Edinburgh Award] and developed with the assistance of [Google Gemini AI] on [GitHub] using [Jekyll] and the [Just the Docs] theme.
